Did Mary have a conversion experience? She said yes to God each day.

## Background

Luke 1:5-24 starts out with the announcement by an angel that John the Baptist will
be born. Gabriel visits Zechariah when he is in the temple offering incense.
Zechariah questions that God can do this, since he is old, and he is left unable to
speak as a result. Mary reacts differently.

## Full of grace

Luke 1:28 is the only place an angel does not call someone by name (compare this to
the greeting Gabriel has for Zechariah in Luke 1:13, for example). The Greek used
for “full of grace” is special. Luke also refers to Steven like this (Acts 6:8),
but the Greek is different. For Mary, the wording implies that she always “has
been” and “is now” full of grace.

## How can this be?

In Luke 1:34 Mary questions Gabriel, like Zechariah did, but her question is full
of faith, not “God cannot do this!”, but rather “How will God do this?”.

Check out Exodus 40:34-38. When the Israelites were wandering in the desert after
being freed from Egypt, the same Greek word translated here as “overshadow” is used
to describe the cloud that covered the tabernacle. This is not an accident that
Luke used the same word.

## The new ark

Luke is trying to show us that Mary is the new Ark of the Covenant. What was in the
Ark? Hebrews 9:4 says that it was manna, Aaron’s staff, and the tables of the
covenant (probably the ones Moses brought down from the mountain).

In the time of David, the Ark had fallen into the hands of the Philistines. Luke
parallels 2 Samuel here describing Mary:

* 2 Sam 6:2 - David “arose and went” to the hill country - Luke 1:39
* 2 Sam 6:9 - David is struck by unworthiness - like Elizabeth in Luke 1:43
* 2 Sam 6:16 - David leaped and danced before the Ark - like John in Luke 1:41
* 2 Sam 6:11 -  The Ark stayed for three months - like Mary in Luke 1:40, 56

It was not only Luke who thought this - see what John saw in Rev 11:15-12:6.

## What is her response?

Mary does not say much in the Gospels, so it is difficult to tell. When greeted by
Elizabeth she gives the glory to God, acknowledging what He has done for her, and
then giving a great summary of Jesus’ future ministry.

She is one of just a few people remaining at the foot of the cross (John 19:26-27).
She was with the disciples after Jesus ascended (Acts 1:14).  She quietly went
about living a life of faith, full of grace from the beginning.  The woman at the
well learned about Jesus and went off telling people - that is the path for some.

But for others, the path is quiet conversion following Jesus each day.
