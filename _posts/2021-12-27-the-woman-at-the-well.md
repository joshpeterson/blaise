In just a moment, what starts as a normal encounter can change your life forever.

## Background

Jesus was in Jerusalem and traveled back to Galilee to avoid the Jewish leaders. He
stopped in Samaria, when Jews normally traveled a longer route along the Jordan
river to avoid Samaria. In 2 Kings 17:24-31 we learn that the Assyrians conquered
the northern kingdom and then settled other people in it. The Jews of the south
considered the Samaritans traitors to the faith. The journey is about 40 miles.
Jesus arrives at noon.

## Finding a bride at the well

Three places in the Old Testament important people find a wife at the well:
* Issac (Genesis 24:10-67)
* Jacob (Genesis 29:1-30)
* Moses (Exodus 2:15-21)

Just before they left Jerusalem, in John 3:29, John the Baptist refers to Jesus as
the groom!

## Living or flowing water?

The word here for “living” could also mean “flowing”. The woman thinks it is
“flowing” which is better than the stagnant water of the well. Only later will she
realize Jesus means “living”.

In the Old Testament, the blessings of the Lord are often represented as
life-giving water (Is 12:3; 44:3, Ezek 47:1-2, Zech 14:8). And of course Baptism is
about water - Jesus’ disciples had just been baptizing at the end of John 3.

## Husbands

The woman has had five husbands - which parallel the five peoples settled in
Samaria in 2 Kings 17. In the Old Testament, false gods are called Baal, the Hebrew
word for “lord” or “husband”. Jesus is the groom who comes to save the Samaritans.

## Where to worship?

The Samaritans worshiped on Mt. Gerizim, the Jews in Jerusalem. Worship in spirit
and truth is

* not in person like in Jerusalem (spirit)
* not with false gods like in Samaria (truth)

## The Messiah

Only in two places, here and at his trial (Mark 14:61-62) does Jesus claim to be
the Messiah. He always hides it - but the faith of this woman is so strong that he
reveals it to her. Even his disciples don’t really know this yet!

## The jar left behind

Why does John tell us this? It shows that the woman has abandoned everything now
after encountering Christ. Her life is changed, she forgets why she was even here.

## What is her response?

She goes off and tells everyone, and they believe because of her. I love what Jesus
says to the disciples when she is gone: “see how the fields are already white for
the harvest.” I can imagine they would look up and see the people pouring out from
the city.
