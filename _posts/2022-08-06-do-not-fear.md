Jarius came to Jesus at a last resort, little did he know that his own faith would play a key role.

## Background

As Jesus gained in popularity, crowds began to follow him around the courntryside. These people we often the poor, sick, or down trodden, looking for hope and healing. But among them this time was a member of high society, Jarius, a "ruler of the synagogue".

## Nothing to lose

I can imagine Jarius at wits end - his young daughter is ill, near death, and nothing anyone can do will help. Then he hears of this healer, Jesus nearby. Leaving behind his status and position in society, he literally falls at the feet of Jesus, begging for healing for his daughter (Mark 5:22-23).

## Roller coaster of emotions

Can you imagine his joy and surprise when Jesus says agrees to go with him! But also, he must be uncertain. There is a large crowd with them, jostling and pushing, what if he looses Jesus in the crowd? How will he find the healer again?

And then, devastation - his daughter has died. He was too late, there is no need to trouble the teacher anymore.

## Faith

But now Jesus does something very surprising.

> But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, “Do not fear, only believe.” (Mark 5:36).

This is the key moment. Amid the noise of the crowd, the chaos of life, the roller coaster of emotions, Jesus cuts through it all, and looks into the heart of Jarius, challegning him to do one thing: _believe_. 

Isn't this the same thing Jesus says to us? No matter what is happening around us, His focus is on our heart, asking us to have faith. In times of crisis we should focus on Jesus, because He is focused on us.

## Into the deep

The faith of Jarius lead Jesus to restore his daughter to life, in anticipation of what Jesus will do for all of us on the cross. Learn more about Mark chapter five in the [Ignatius Catholic Study Bible](https://ignatius.com/the-gospel-according-to-mark-2nd-ed-22mkp/).
