John (and only John) speaks of the "hour" of Christ often. What does this odd
phrase mean?

## Background

We find "the hour" listed at least 20 times in the Gospel of John, and pretty much
no where in the other three Gospels. This odd turn of phrase is used by John to tie
together a liturgical theme that unites the first half of his Gospel (chapters
1-12) with the second half (chapters 13 and later).

## The hour and the wine

Jesus' first miracle happens at the request of his mother, the changing of water
into wine at the wedding in Cana.  Check out John 2:4 - Jesus says "My hour has not
yet come." when Mary asks him about the wine. What an odd answer! That is, unless
he does plan to provide wine when it does come.

## The hour and the worship

During his conversation with the [Samaritan woman](/the-woman-at-the-well/) in John
4:21 Jesus says the hour is coming, and is now here when people will worship in
spirit and truth - a new way of worshiping that will unite Jews and Samaritans.

## The hour and the word

In John 5:25 after healing on the Sabbath Jesus says that there is a new way to
hear the Word of God because the Word has become flesh. No longer will the Word
only be heard in Jewish synagogues, but it will be heard even by the dead!

## The hour and the bread

Jesus discusses his coming glorification, again called his "hour" (John 12:20-27) by
using the image of a grain of wheat that dies and yields more fruit - wheat or, in
others words, bread. All of this in response to a simple question from some Greeks
who want to speak with him!

## The hour has come

Finally, in John 13:1 the hour had come. This is the second half of John's Gospel,
and the hour which Jesus has so enigmatically spoken about again and again (I can
just imagine the confusion among his disciples) finally arrives. What is the
context? The Last Supper, where Jesus institutes the Eucharist and provides the
liturgical foundation for the church.

Now that the hour has come he will provide wine, a new way of worshiping, a new way
of hearing the Word of God, and bread.
