Simon of Cyrene played a bit part in the Gospels, but this chance encounter with
Jesus became a huge part of his life.

## Background

Cyrene was a city in North Africa, which, at the time of Christ, had a large Jewish
population. As Jesus carried the cross to Golgotha, it was important that he did
not die on the way. Both the Romans and the Jewish leaders wanted to make a show of
him, so he must be alive before being crucified. Enter Simon of Cyrene.

## Not quite an extra

If the story of Jesus were a movie, Simon plays a bit part. He is slightly more
than an "extra", but he has no lines, and merits just one verse in each of three
Gospels: Matthew 27:32, Luke 23:26, and Mark 15:21. We know that Simon was "coming
in from the fields" and that he was tasked by the soldiers to carry the cross for
Jesus, but the rest of his story is left to speculation.

## Who me?

I can imagine the soldiers seeing a strong-looking fellow (he had come in from the
fields - maybe he was bigger than most in the crowd) and grabbing hold of him. I
can imagine a moment of protest from Simon. "I'm just trying to get through the
crowd." But you don't say "no" to a group of Roman soldiers. And you don't say "no"
to the gaze of Christ. So Simon took up a cross that was not his and he carried it
through the winding streets of Jerusalem.

## A father himself

Mark, who is often very concise with words, gives us one interesting, and seemingly
meaningless detail - Simon was the father of Alexander and Rufus. Apparently these
two names meant something to the readers of Mark's Gospel. Is this the same Rufus
Paul mentions in Romans 16:13? Are these the "men of Cyprus and Cyrene" from Acts
11:20? We cannot know for sure. But Mark's inclusion means that likely this was not
the end of the story for Simon. As with all of those who encounter Jesus,
his life was very likely changed. I can imagine, as Simon is kicked aside by the soldiers
when they reach Golgotha, Jesus glances back at him with gratitude and knows he can
count Simon as a follower from that moment on.

## Into the deep

How often are we given a task for which we are not prepared? Will we respond as
Simon did? For more, check out this great [article about
