Conversion is a powerful motivator, but what happens when all of the excitement of initial conversion runs out, and we're back to the real world?

## Background

It is Sunday, Jesus has risen from the dead, but very few people know yet. In
Luke’s account, Mary Magdalene and a few others see the empty tomb and meet angels.
Peter does as well, but no one has seen Jesus yet. The disciples are scared and
stick to the upper room, for fear of the Jews. Clopas and a friend (maybe his wife,
see John 19:25) are traveling the seven mile journey from Jerusalem to Emmaus.

## Great expectations

The disciples thought that Jesus was the prophet (Lk 24:19) foretold by Moses (Deut
18:15). They expected him to free them from Roman oppression, and restore Israel’s
political freedom. This is what Palm Sunday was all about (Mark 11:10)! Check out
Acts 1:6 - they still think this even 50 days later when we ascended. They were not
thinking big enough though!

Put yourself in their shoes, these disciples had given up everything to follow
Jesus, and now - this?!?

## A firm rebuke

Jesus is very clear with them - they should know this! But look what he does - he
proceeds to explain it to them from the Old Testament on. He starts with Moses -
whom they thought had prophesied about him. I would have loved to be walking along
with them. Can you imagine? Here is the Word of God himself explaining the
scriptures! Did they take notes?

## Where Jesus did not go

Jesus did not visit Peter or James, or John and start planning out the church. He
did not drop in on Caiaphas or Pilate - “Remember me?”. No, he came to followers
who were in despair, in need of conversion. He came quietly, like the still, small
voice Elijah heard (1 Kings 19:11-13). Only later did he reveal himself.

## The breaking of the bread

How did the disciples respond? They asked Jesus to stay with them - they wanted to
go deeper, to know more. So what did Jesus do? He sat down for a meal, blessed and
broke the bread (Lk 22:19) - this is the common wording used for the last supper.
At the moment he was revealed to the disciples and then he disappeared.  This is
the mass - the Liturgy of the Word, then the Liturgy of the Eucharist.

## What is their response?

They kind of look at each other - “Did not our hearts burn within us…” (Lk 24:32).
Then they get up, despite the day being long gone, and immediately return to
Jerusalem. After learning of Jesus, they must go back and share the good news!
